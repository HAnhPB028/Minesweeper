# Minesweeper Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic **Minesweeper** game written in Java. The game allows the player to uncover cells on a grid, with the goal of avoiding hidden mines. If a player uncovers a mine, the game ends. The player can also flag cells they suspect contain mines.

## Features

- **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: The game includes different levels (easy, medium, hard) with varying grid sizes and numbers of mines.
- **Undo Function**: You can undo your last move.
- **Game State Management**: The game maintains the state of the grid to support undo functionality.
- **Win/Loss Detection**: The game detects when you've won or lost.
- **Flagging Mines**: You can flag cells where you think a mine is located.

## Rule

1. Click on a cell to uncover it.
2. Right-click to flag a cell as containing a mine.
3. If you uncover a mine, the game ends with a loss.
4. The goal is to uncover all non-mine cells without triggering any mines.
